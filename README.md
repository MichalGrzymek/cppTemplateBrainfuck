# cppTemplateBrainfuck
My brainfuck interpreter in c++ templates, [inspired by this one](https://github.com/tfc/cpp_template_meta_brainfuck_interpreter).
Compile with -ftemplate-depth=9999 (or more) to see the output in the compiler error message.
Tested with clang and gcc.
Default code is Hello World!, it must be hardcoded in the c++ source, and the input to the brainfuck program must be hardcoded in the brainfuck source.
